CimFS API Sample Application
============================

This sample demonstrates how to use the Composite Image File System (CimFS) APIs to create, configure, and manipulate CimFS Images. The sample demonstrates how to perform each of the following operations:

-   Create a new CIM image using the **CimCreateImage** method.
-   Commit changes to the image using the **CimCommitImage** method.
-   Add a file from the local filesystem to the image using the **CimCreateFile** and **CimWriteStream** methods.
-   Mount and validate image contents using the **CimMountImage** method.
-   Add a hardlink to an existing file in the image using the **CimCreateHardLink** method.
-   Fork from the base image.
-   Delete a file from the forked CIM image.

Operating system requirements
-----------------------------

Client: Windows 10 Version 2004 and above

SDK: Windows SDK 10.0.19041.0 and above

Build the sample
----------------

1.  Start Visual Studio and select **File** \> **Open** \> **Project/Solution**.

2.  Go to the directory named for the sample, and double-click the Microsoft Visual Studio Solution (.sln) file titled Networking.sln.

3.  Use **Build** \> **Build Solution** to build the sample.

Run the sample
--------------

**CimFSAPI.exe** [cim_path] [image_name] [file_to_add_path] [image_relative_path]

cim_path - The path to the location where the generated cims will be stored. e.g. C:\cim

image_name - The name of the cim image. e.g. test.cim

file_to_add_path - The path on the source filesystem of a file to be added to the cim. e.g. C:\Windows\System32\ntdll.dll

image_relative_path - The path in the cim to the source file. e.g. dir\ntdll.dll

This will create 2 cim images:

The first CIM will contain the file specified by file_to_add_path at the image_relative_path and a hardlink to that file in the same directory.

The second CIM will be a fork of the first CIM, with the original file deleted but the hardlink still present.
